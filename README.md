DCIM app logical layer code samples
=======

It is a repo for parts of code of the DCIM project I was involved in.

The code here alone is NOT a fully functional backend service. But it demonstrates how the application was structured, as well as how the objects were designed in the application.

The whole app uses a J2EE framework and the services follow the RESTful concept.
